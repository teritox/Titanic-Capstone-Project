# Titanic-Capstone-Project-

Python AI / ML student project. Capstone project built on machine learning systen based on real-world data and deployed as a django web application.

The Titanic datasets are provided by Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

Project Overview
The Titanic++ Capstone Project is an end-to-end machine learning and web development project that demonstrates how a predictive model can be built from raw data and deployed as a real-world application.
Using historical passenger data from the Titanic disaster, this project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived based on demographic and travel-related features such as age, gender, passenger class, and family size. The trained model is integrated into a Django-based web application where users can input passenger details and receive survival predictions along with probability scores.
The system also persists prediction inputs and results in a database, allowing users to view prediction history. The project follows software engineering best practices including modular design, version control with Git, and clear documentation.
This project simulates a realistic production-style workflow that combines data science, machine learning, backend web development, and deployment principles.

Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in building and deploying a complete machine learning system rather than focusing only on model accuracy.
Specifically, this project aims to:

- Develop a strong understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
- Practice building reproducible machine learning pipelines
- Learn how to deploy a trained ML model inside a Django web application
- Understand how machine learning systems interact with databases and user interfaces
- Apply software engineering best practices, including modular design and separation of concerns
- Improve proficiency with Git and GitHub through continuous, meaningful commits
- Simulate a real-world ML product lifecycle, from raw data to user-facing application
  Overall, the project bridges the gap between theoretical machine learning and practical software development by delivering a fully functional prediction system that mirrors how ML-powered applications are built in industry.
