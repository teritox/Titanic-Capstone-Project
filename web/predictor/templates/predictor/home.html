            <h1>Titanic Survival Prediction System</h1>
            <p>Machine Learning–powered survival analysis</p>

    <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        Using real-world passenger data from the Titanic dataset, this project demonstrates
        the full machine learning workflow — from data exploration and preprocessing to
        model training, evaluation, and deployment as a web application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system allows users to enter passenger information and receive a survival
        prediction along with the model’s confidence.
    </p>

    <h2>Data and Machine Learning Approach</h2>
    <p>
        The machine learning model is trained on historical Titanic passenger data containing
        both numerical and categorical features, as well as missing values. Data cleaning and
        preprocessing steps are applied to handle these challenges in a justified and systematic
        way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feature engineering is used to improve model performance by creating meaningful
        features such as passenger titles, family size, and age groups. The final model is
        evaluated using multiple metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrix analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>System Design and Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        The application is built using Django as the web framework and scikit-learn for machine
        learning. The trained machine learning pipeline is saved and loaded into the Django
        application for prediction purposes only, ensuring a clear separation between model
        training and web logic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Django handles user input validation, prediction requests, and database storage.
        Each prediction, including input data, predicted outcome, prediction probability, and
        timestamp, is stored in the database and can be viewed on the history page.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the Application</h2>
    <p>
        Navigate to the prediction page to enter passenger details and receive a survival
        prediction. Previous predictions can be reviewed on the history page.
